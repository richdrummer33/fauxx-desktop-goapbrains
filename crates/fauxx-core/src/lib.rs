//! `fauxx-core` is the headless core of the Fauxx desktop companion.
//!
//! All real work (persona orchestration, the scheduler, browser automation,
//! measurement, cross-device sync) lives here behind a clean async API. The
//! Iced GUI (`apps/desktop`) and the clap CLI (`apps/cli`) are thin clients
//! over this crate. That split buys the headless/homelab mode for free and
//! keeps the GUI toolkit reversible.
//!
//! The public surface is the concrete [`Core`] facade: cheap to clone (shared
//! state is behind an [`Arc`]), with inherent `async fn` methods so it stays
//! object-safe-free and simple. C0 wires up the persona subsystem (backed by
//! the encrypted [`store`]); the scheduler, browser, measurement, and sync
//! subsystems exist as stubs (see [`subsystems`]) that pin the API shape and
//! fill in over C1-C8.
//!
//! Architecture invariants: no GUI/CLI types leak into this API; the store is
//! reachable only through [`Core`] (there is no public database handle); the
//! crate is 100% local (no network, no telemetry); and the store fails closed
//! (a missing/underivable key is an error, never an unencrypted open).
