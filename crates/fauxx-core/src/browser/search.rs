//! Search-engine decoy poisoning (C6 H1): drive the isolated decoy browser to
//! issue persona-aligned search queries, so a phone-less / homelab desktop
//! pollutes search-engine and broker profiles the way the Android
//! `SearchPoisonModule` does, not only by visiting category sites.
//!
//! Each query string is produced + safety-gated by
//! [`crate::querybank::QueryGenerator`] BEFORE it reaches here; this module only
//! builds a SERP URL and navigates to it through the SAME guarded path as every
//! other decoy visit (`DecoyPage::navigate` -> the R3 auth-flow blocklist +
//! HTTPS-only check), then dwells with the persona's cadence. A search is, by
//! construction, a GET to a public SERP with credentials omitted; no form is
//! submitted and no real account is touched.
//!
//! US/English only today (the SERP locale params are hardcoded to `en`/`US`),
//! matching the desktop persona model. Each category runs an intent-chain session:
//! a goal query followed by `0..=MAX_SESSION_REFINEMENTS` in-topic refinements
//! on the same engine. Still deferred: organic SERP-link following.
